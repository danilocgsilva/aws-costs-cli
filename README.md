# AWS cost utility 

Get human readable costs data from AWS account.

By default, bring each day cost since a month ago. You can custom the period of fetching the data.

## Installing

Go to the project's root directory and then types:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

## Using

In the command line, type:
```
awscosts --profile <your_aws_profile_name>
```


By default, the output is setted to get data costs from a month ago until the current date. But if you want to set a different starting period, do:
```
awscosts --profile <your_aws_profile_name> --start-time 2022-02-16
```

Maybe you want to plot the day-by-day costs in a graph. You can change the data output to csv format, so you can use in your own application as data input or to plot a graph i Libreoffice.

```
awscosts --profile <your_aws_profile_name> --format csv
```
